# Aim Trainer
### A very simple game inspired by Dean "peppy" Herbert's osu!
Welcome to a simple game I made for my university assignment about game coding using C++ and SDL library!
## Introduction
I've had a strong passion for rhythm-based video games, especially a game called osu!, which introduced me to many banger music that gives me motivation to keep working, and this assignment gives me the best chance to try to recreate that has been an important part of my life.
## Gameplay
- The gameplay is as simple as aiming at the square and click it when they appear on the screen at a random location, and the game will end if the time between two clicks exceeds 0.727 seconds.
- There is a **EVEN HARDER** mode implemented in the game that cuts down the area of the square to only 25% that of the original square. This will be the true test to your aiming skill. 
- And if you had enough with this game, there is a mode that will help relieve your anger, which is called **"quit"**. This mode will help you quit the game and you can spend your time on other things in your life instead of playing games.
## Features
- Two game mode, Normal and **Hard**
- The game utilize features in **only** the SDL2 library, without any other sub-libraries such as SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer, etc, because my computer has a *huge* problem running these libraries.
- All of the graphics in the game were made ***by me***, using my creativity and the editor of another favourite game of mine called "Geometry Dash", developed by RobTop Games. Technically, all the premade objects in that game were created by RobTop Games, so you could say that my game resources were created by him, too.
## Future plans for this game
- Improve the quality of all the resourcews like the square, the background, and the menu button, and also 
- A click counter that indicated how many squares you have clicked.
- My favourite musics that will makes you **addicted** to this game<br/>
**All of this will be added if I *somehow* figure out what is the cause of all the errors that prevents me from working with the SDL_image and SDL_ttf library**
## Contributors
- Dean "peppy" Herbert, for creating the game "osu!".
- RobTop Games, for developing "Geometry Dash" and creates all the premade objects for me.
